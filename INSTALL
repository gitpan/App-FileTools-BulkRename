This is the Perl distribution App-FileTools-BulkRename.

Installing App-FileTools-BulkRename is straightforward.

## Installation with cpanm

If you have cpanm, you only need one line:

    % cpanm App::FileTools::BulkRename

If you are installing into a system-wide directory, you may need to pass the
"-S" flag to cpanm, which uses sudo to install the module:

    % cpanm -S App::FileTools::BulkRename

## Installing with the CPAN shell

Alternatively, if your CPAN shell is set up, you should just be able to do:

    % cpan App::FileTools::BulkRename

## Manual installation

As a last resort, you can manually install it. Download the tarball,
untar it, then build and install it. 

If you are installing into a system-wide directory, then:

    % perl Makefile.PL
    % make && make test
    % sudo make install

That last command may just be 'make install' depending on your privileges.

If you are installing into a local directory, then

    % perl Makefile.PL INSTALL_BASE=~
    % make && make test
    % make install

This will install the executable into ~/bin, the man pages into ~/man
and the needed library files into directories below ~/lib

## Documentation

App-FileTools-BulkRename documentation is available as POD.
