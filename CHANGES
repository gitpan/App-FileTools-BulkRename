    Massive reorganization to track down a crash caused by a library upgrade.

commit b3517d4736269a585c90e31ca0b7ab253c568bff
Author: Stirling Westrup <swestrup@gmail.com>
Date:   Mon May 31 23:36:28 2010 -0400

    Massive changes, but config files now work much better
    
    Changes include:
    
    * Using a config file library, instead of our homebrew stuff.
    * Should be able to resolve multiple -u options that refer to
      config files containing references to yet other -u options in yet
      other config files (barely tested).
    * Multiple -u options on one command line should now work, in order given.
    * Also, we now explicitly support multiple -M, -p and -L options.
    * Cleaned up documentation a bit.
    
    Still to do:
    * Record all renamings before doing any, so we can
      A) implement -a which asks for confirmation, and
      B) detect two files which would be renamed to the same thing.
    * Created tied versions of the helper commands, to reduce verbosity.
